## About

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at New York University, expecting to graduate in May 2022. I am currently searching for jobs.

- 👨‍🔬 My dissertation is  on education and migration in the United States  in the 19th century.
- 👩‍💻 I mostly use R (data.table, sf, fixest, huxtable and many others) and Python (pandas, scipy, SymPy, beautifulsoup) in my workflow.
- 🔨 Since you are here,  I highly recommend some less-known free/cheap apps and tools for grad students (and professors!) in Economics. I use a Mac. 
  - [**SlidePilot**](https://github.com/SlidePilot/SlidePilot-macOS), a great app for running beamer (or any pdf) presentations, with instant slide rendering and other nice features like a timer and quick shortcut for "empty white slide"
  - [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/) which helps with managing your collection of pdf's, supporting search, automatix bibtex integration and "drag-and-drop" import of pdf files that looks like magic (I have not typed in a bibtex entry manually in years)
  - [**rmate**](https://github.com/aurora/rmate) which I use to edit scripts on remote servers such as NYU's HPC. It works great with Sublime Text and VSCode.
  - [**Ipe**](https://ipe.otfried.org/), a diagram editor with Latex support. I get very frustrated with Tikz because it's hard. I am also frustrated with Powerpoint because it does not support proper math typesetting. Ipe is easy and beautiful if you need a diagram with math expressions.
  - [**ImageOptim**](https://imageoptim.com/mac) that helps me shrink the size of thousands of images of archival data I collected for my dissertation.
  - [**Mathpix**](https://mathpix.com/) that allows to screenshot an expression in pdf and instantly convert it to latex. It now supports tables and entire papers as well!
  - [**Sublime Merge**](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) that makes it much easier to work with Git because it offers great visualizations of what is going on.
