## About

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at New York University, expecting to graduate in May 2022. I am currently searching for jobs.

- 👨‍🔬 My dissertation is on education and migration in the United States in the 19th century. I work with full-count Census Data, studying the location choices of millions of people who lived in the US in 1850-1880.
- 👩‍💻 I mostly use R (data.table, sf, fixest, huxtable and many others) and Python (pandas, scipy, SymPy, beautifulsoup) in my workflow.
- 🔨 Since you are here,  I'd like to recommend a few less-known free/cheap apps and tools for grad students (and professors!) in Economics. I use a Mac. 
  - [**SlidePilot**](https://github.com/SlidePilot/SlidePilot-macOS) runs beamer (or any pdf) presentations, with instant slide rendering and other nice features like a timer and a quick shortcut for "show empty white slide".
  - [**Zotero**](https://www.zotero.org/) manages my collection of citations and pdfs, supporting search, automatic bibtex integration, and "drag-and-drop" import of pdf files that looks like magic. I have not typed in a bibtex entry manually in years.
  - [**rmate**](https://github.com/aurora/rmate) that I use for editing scripts on remote servers such as NYU's HPC. It works neatly with Sublime Text and VSCode.
  - [**Ipe**](https://ipe.otfried.org/), a diagram editor with full Latex support, including packages. I get very frustrated with Tikz because it's hard and takes too much time. I am also frustrated with Powerpoint because it does not support proper math typesetting. Ipe is easy and beautiful if you need a diagram with math expressions.
  - [**ImageOptim**](https://imageoptim.com/mac) helped me shrink the size of thousands of images of archival data I collected for my dissertation.
  - [**Mathpix**](https://mathpix.com/) allows can screenshot an expression in pdf and instantly convert it to latex. It recently gained support for tables and entire papers as well!
  - [**Sublime Merge**](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) makes it much easier to work with Git because it offers great visualizations of what is going on.
